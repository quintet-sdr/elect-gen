# Elect.Gen

A distribution system to assign students to electives.

## ⌛ Problem

Manually distributing students to electives every year is tedious and time-intensive.

## 🚀 Solution

This system automates the abovementioned process using a genetic algorithm. We also provide a convenient GUI to ease the integration into the university ecosystem.
